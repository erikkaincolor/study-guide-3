Flask and Jinja2


.get() is a method from the dictionary class.  
It allows you to safely access the value a dictionary holds 
for a particular key.  Both request.args  (in the case of GET 
requests) and request.form (in the case of POST requests) are 
dictionaries, so either can use .get() the access values.  
Remember that the HTTP GET method and the dictionary .get() 
just happen to have the same name, but the word "get" means 
very different things in those contexts. -adam


    What is the request object in Flask? What can you use it for?
its a dictionary.
its in the app route decorator function as request.form.get() or request.args.get() and 
it accesses form data in the specified route....and depending on the method either gets that info and submits elsewhere or places it on same page

    In Flask, how do you access form values for a POST request? How about for a GET request?
request.form.get() in the app route decorator function AND in app.routes parameters AND in the <form> tag of the html in the html file specify its POST

request.args.get() in the app route decorator function and the fact that its a GET method(no side effects) is default




























    What is Jinja? What does the function render_template do?
jinja is a way to put js in htmlthe render-template is a function of flask and allows 
us to put the template html url in the return of the app decorator function in the server file
INSTEAD of raw html in the return

    Jinja syntax to know

        For-loops
{% for name in names %}
<li>{{ repeating var }}</li>
{% endfor %}


        If-statements
<div><p>
{% if name :%}

//might have a for loop innit

{% end if %}
</p>
</div>


        Showing text with Jinja
via variable in js's curly braces 
<p> hey there, {{ name }}</p>

        Setting HTML attributes using Jinja
template inheritance?? wait for adams reply

        Template inheritance (using a base.html to create consistency)


























How the Web Works

    When you type a URL into a web browser, what happens?
-the browser sends a request to the server to retrieve the page....in a get request (public)
-server responds...interacts with db, 

        Be able to explain this in your own words, hitting each main concept from the lecture.

    What are the five main components of a URL?
-protocol (http, https)
-host name
-protocol
-url/resouce
-query

    What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request?
    What is POST method?
secure retrieval of form data and sent to the db...data retrieval 

    What is GET method?
insecure and is just seen in the address bar by anyone...data retrieval 
GET: passes arguments via the URL
Gives you a warning if you reload: “Confirm Form Resubmission”
Used for requests with side effects (e.g. saving data to a database)

APIs and Requests Library

    What are the core tenets of REST in the context of APIs?
-set of rules in industry api making
-req or response will include all data
    How can you keep your API access tokens out of git? What should you do if you accidentally add your API tokens to git?
secret.sh in .gitignore
make repo private or delete
pray
    Why is it bad to push your API tokens to git?
API key VS API Token:
The main distinction between these two is: API keys 
identify the calling project — the application or site — 
making the call to an API. 

Authentication tokens identify a user — 
the person — that is using the app or site.













Testing

    What are doctests? How do you create and run them?
tests you use to test script functionality piece by piece

still have to review slower lecture once uploaded

unit test is a bundle of tests via testing class in unittest module 

integration test is testing a washer machine for bedding or delicates...whether
compenents work together
